Zandercraft Bot is a chat, productivity, GIFs, and fun bot. It's main feature is it's ability to play XHD (extra HD). This feature is activated using the +voice command followed by +request {song name}. It also has commands like +snack where the bot returns some food emojis which then you can do +eat to pretend to eat them. Since the Zandercraft bot is built for customizability, you are able to set a server specific prefix, custom messages for when someone tries to run a command that they are not allowed to use, a custom welcome message to welcome new members to your server via PMs, and whether or not to allow potentially NSFW memes in specific channels.
