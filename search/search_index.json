Zandercraft Bot is a chat, productivity, GIFs, and fun bot. It's main feature is it's ability to play XHD (extra HD). This feature is activated using the +voice command followed by +request {song name}. It also has commands like +snack where the bot returns some food emojis which then you can do +eat to pretend to eat them. Since the Zandercraft bot is built for customizability, you are able to set a server specific prefix, custom messages for when someone tries to run a command that they are not allowed to use, a custom welcome message to welcome new members to your server via PMs, and whether or not to allow potentially NSFW memes in specific channels. The Zandercraft Bot is hosted on our servers up here in Canada.\nMake sure to check out our website at \nzandercraft.cf\n for some extra information.\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nThe Zandercraft Bot developer team includes \nZander\n, \nShadeyG\n, and \nDragon\n.
